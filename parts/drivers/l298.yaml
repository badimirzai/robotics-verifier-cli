  # Logic supply (Vss)
  logic_voltage_min: 5.0
  logic_voltage_max: 7.0

  # This driver runs hot. Set conservative current numbers.
  # Many modules advertise 2A, but thermal reality is worse without serious heatsinking.

notes:
  - "Logic is 5V-class. 3.3V MCU usually needs level shifting."
  - "Thermal limits dominate; treat advertised currents as optimistic unless you have heatsinking."
confidence:
  motor_voltage_max: high
  logic_voltage_min: medium
  current_continuous: medium
